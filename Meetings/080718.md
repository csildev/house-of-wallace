4 house chapels

## 4 house service days
each house has a service day for all the houses to get together

something for everyone to do

Wallace's is february 22

### What has been done in the past

filling bags with dog food for elderly people.

we want something that is actual service instead of just giving money

## Talk about people's vacations
Mr Holland went somewhere that smelled of sulphur 

## House positions
People should be doing what their position is more than last year
because many of the people were not able to carry out their position
as much as they should

## Who could be asked to speak at the house chapel
TODO: Get the information about who are possibilities

## Chapels at meetings
We really need to start having chapels at all the meetings
which really fell off the bus last year about having chapels
before all the meetings.

Maybe going through the bible. Definitely not ephesians because
that would double up.

The gospel of luke is a possibility

## Plans for house meetings
We need to have a plan for every house meeting so that we do not just 
slack off in house meetings
